# Buissnes logic :

* Model stores data and communicates directly with the database. Model is the part that represents your data and application logic. It defines the business rules that manage data handling, modification, or processing.
* View displays the model's data and is responsible for the dataâ€™s representation in the user interface.
* ViewModel is exclusive to MVVM pattern. This is an abstraction of the view layer and also acts as a wrapper for the model data.
* Controller is the component that integrates the view and model.
* Presenter is a component that only exists in the MVP model. Presenter gets the input from the view component and processes the data with the help of the model.

## Lab_6_Done:
I implimented solid principles into my project, and used at some extent of buisness logic.
